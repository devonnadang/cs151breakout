# Project Overview
This project was inspired by the classic Atari Breakout game. Our project used the Java Swing library and was implemented with MVC design pattern, Singleton pattern, and key bindings. 

# How to play
The objective of the game is to destroy all the blocks with the ball by using the paddle to keep the ball in the air. The user is given 3 lives and can move the paddle left and right.
